# physical_ai_av

This repository contains a python developer kit and documentation (in the form of a [wiki](https://github.com/NVlabs/physical_ai_av/wiki) and interactive [notebooks](notebooks/)) for working with the [NVIDIA Physical AI Autonomous Vehicles Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/PhysicalAI-Autonomous-Vehicles), one of the largest, most geographically diverse collections of multi-sensor data empowering AV researchers to build the next generation of Physical AI based end-to-end driving systems.

## Installation & Setup
```
pip install physical_ai_av
```
